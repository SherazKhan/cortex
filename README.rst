ND Neural Nets for ecsemble learning


Description
===========

Most of the Deep Neural nets are arranged in two dimensional grid like structure, here we proposed cortex like structure, where various 2D NN are embeded in N Dimensional manifold, this will ensure less dependence on intilization and will promote ensemble learning.

Note
====

Currently this project is in alpga stage, stay tuned for the updates.
